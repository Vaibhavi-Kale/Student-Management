# Student-Management System


The student application in Java is designed to manage and organize student information efficiently, providing a comprehensive system for educational institutions. Each student's profile includes essential details such as Roll No, Name, Email, Date of Birth (dob), and a Photo, ensuring a complete and organized record for each individual. Users can add new student profiles, update existing ones, and remove profiles as needed. The application also allows for searching and retrieving student information quickly, making it easy for administrators and teachers to access and manage student data.

Login Module ensures that only authorized users can access the application by requiring a valid username and password. For enhanced security, 
Reset Password module allows users to reset their password by sending a One-Time Password (OTP) to their registered email address, ensuring that only the rightful user can change the password. 
Change Password module requires users to enter their old password before setting a new one, adding an extra layer of security against unauthorized changes.
Search module searching and retrieving student information quickly, making it easy for administrators and teachers to access and manage student data.
